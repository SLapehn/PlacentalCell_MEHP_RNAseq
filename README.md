# PlacentalCell_MEHP_RNAseq
This repository contains code from the Paquette Lab for performing RNA sequencing analysis of placental cells exposed to phthalate metabolite, MEHP.

There are five RMarkdown files that were each used for a different part of the analysis which include: 
  1) Analysis of HTR-8/SVneo cells
  2) Analysis of Combined-sex primary syncytiotrophoblasts
  3) Analysis of Male primary synyctiotrophoblasts
  4) Analysis of Female primary synyctiotrophoblasts
  5) Comparison of HTR-8/SVneo and primary synyctiotrophoblast results
